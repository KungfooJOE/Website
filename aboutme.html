          Hello there! As you could probably tell from the website domain name,
          my name is Joseph Straw and this website serves as my personal creative
          outlet, as well as a reference guide for some of my projects that I work
          on.
        </li>
          <br>
        <li>I am currently working on the qualifications needed in becoming a
          software engineer of some sort. It's been a dream of mine to work in the field
          of software development, but I have never focused 100% of my effort on
          achieving it. However, since I finished college, I have a renewed passion
          and drive to finally achieve my dream. Maybe the yobos at college spooked
          me into doing something other than manual labour, who knows.
          </li>

    <h2 class="containersub">Why the website?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To answer the question simply. I wanted to make a start and put my newly acquired skills to use. You might be thinking: <i>“What skills? This website is nothing but a bunch of simple HTML and CSS!”</i> but I did that on purpose. If I really wanted too, I would implement some Javascript to make the site look better, but I believe there is beauty in simplicity. I mean, look at the internet 15 years ago and how much simpler it was to get to where you needed to go. Keyword being <i>"needed"</i>. Nowadays, it's so much easier for people, especially zoomers like myself, to get side-tracked and lose sight of what we went onto the internet to look for in the first place!

    <h2 class="containersub">So what have I accomplished?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          As of September 2021, I had finished secondary school with a grade 4 in mathematics and grade 5 in english language, as well as a one year GCSE+ course (achieving two grade 6s and a grade 7) at college. So with my next step being a bit of a mystery, I started to work on my skills with programming and web development, which were until then, just a hobby I partook in during my spare time. <a href="https://github.com/KungfooJOE" target="_blank">Click Here</a>  to see my Github page and all of the projects I have worked on over the course of the past year!
        </li>
        <br>
        <p>So what have I worked on during my time learning web development and programming? Well, I have:</p>
        <li>Created a <a href="https://github.com/KungfooJOE/Pong-Clone" target="_blank">Pong Clone</a> in Python3 using the pygame modual</li>
        <li>Created <a href="https://github.com/KungfooJOE/Website" target="_blank">This Website</a> in HTML and CSS</li>
