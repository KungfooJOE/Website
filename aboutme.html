      <ul>
        <li>Hello there! As you could probably tell from the website domain name,
          my name is Joseph Straw and this website serves as my personal creative
          outlet, as well as a reference guide for some of my projects that I work
          on.</li>
          <br>
        <li>I am currently working on the qualifications needed in becoming a
          full stack developer. It's been a dream of mine to work in the field
          of software development, but I have never focused 100% of my effort on
          achieving it. However, since I finished college, I have a renewed passion
          and drive to finally achieve my dream. Maybe the yobos at college spooked
          me into doing something other than manual labour, who knows.
          </li>
